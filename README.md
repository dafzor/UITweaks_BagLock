UITweaks_BagLock
================
An addon to stop bags from moving unintentionally, adapted from [ElTorqiro_UITweaks](https://github.com/eltorqiro/TSW-UITweaks).

What is this?
-------------
This is the ElTorquiro_UITweaks BagLock plugin stripped out and made into a stand alone mod using thee Skeleton mod example from the Official Discord #modding channel.

It's intended to provide most of the plugin functionality as a stand alone mod for Secret World Legends without any of the issues.

-------------
Options are provided by using /setoption to set the following variables to true or false:
* `/setoption UITweaks_BagLock_Enabled` - Enables the lock. (default: true)
* `/setoption UITweaks_BagLock_OverrideOnShift` - Allow bags to move when Shift key is pressed. (default: true)
* `/setoption UITweaks_BagLock_OverrideOnCtrl` - Allow bags to move when Ctrl key is pressed. (default: false)
* `/setoption UITweaks_BagLock_OverrideOnAlt` - Allow bags to move when Alt key is pressed. (default: false)
